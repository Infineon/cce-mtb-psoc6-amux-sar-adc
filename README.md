# PSoC 6 MCU: Extending the number of SAR ADC channels

*Disclaimer: This is a community code example (CCE) released for the benefit of the community users. These projects have only been tested for the listed BSPs, tools versions, and toolchains documented in this readme. They are intended to demonstrate how a solution / concept / use-case can be achieved on a particular device. For official code examples, please click [here](https://github.com/Infineon/Code-Examples-for-ModusToolbox-Software).*

This code example demonstrates how to extend the number of SAR ADC channels to virtually any available analog pin in the device without much impact on the sampling speed. It is implemented totally in hardware by using the global analog mux, instead of the SAR mux sequencer. 

## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade; software](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) v3.0 or later (tested with v3.0)
- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version for:
   - PSoC&trade; 6 MCU: v4.0.0
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: All [PSoC&trade; 6 MCU](https://www.infineon.com/PSoC6) parts

## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; embedded compiler v10.3.1 (`GCC_ARM`) - Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`

## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; Prototyping Kit](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CPROTO-062-4343W) (`CY8CPROTO-062-4343W`) 
- [PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; Pioneer Kit](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) (`CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT`)
- [PSoC&trade; 62S2 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; Pioneer Kit](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-062S2-43012) (`CY8CKIT-062S2-43012`) â€“ Default value of `TARGET`

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

By default, this code examples uses Port 9, Port 10 and Port 12 as analog inputs (total of 24 analog channels for the SAR ADC). But you can virtually use any available analog pin from your hardware. You might need to apply a voltage between GND and the maximum allowed voltage in the SAR ADC to test this code example.

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br />

The following example clones the "[AMux SAR ADC](https://github.com/Infineon/cce-mtb-psoc6-amux-sar-adc)" application with the desired name "AMuxSAR" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT --app-id cce-mtb-psoc6-amux-sar-adc --user-app-name AMuxSAR --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br />

Following example adds the CY8CPROTO-062-4343W BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   ~/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/library-manager/library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyHelloWorld" --add-bsp-name CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   ~/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/library-manager/library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyHelloWorld" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CPROTO-062-4343W
   ```

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the UART terminal displays as shown in **Figure 1**.

   **Figure 1. Terminal output on SAR ADC measurements in counts**

   ![](images/terminal_window.png)

5. Change the voltage in a given pin and check the results in the terminal. If you don't have an external power source or a potentiometer, you can ground the pin and check the measurements settles to around 0 counts, or connect VDDA to the pin and check the measurements saturates at 2047 counts.

## Debugging


You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice â€“ once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

This code example implements two new middleware:
- AMux: a wrapper to the HSIOM registers to establish connections to the global analog mux A or B. It also supports DMA to update the internal connections without CPU intervention.
- Sampler: it adds DMA support to move data from a single channel ADC to an array of samples. It also has an internal timer to trigger the SAR ADC periodically and an external DMA (in this example, the AMux DMA).

In this example, the application samples 24 channels and prints their count values to the console terminal.

An overall block diagram of this code example is shown below:

   **Figure 2. Block diagram**

   ![](images/adc_amux.png)

The user is responsible to configure and initialize the SAR ADC and establish the trigger connections between the SAR ADC, the Timer and DMAs. However, the DMA and Timer configuration is handled by the Sampler and AMux middleware. It is assumed that the Timer's clock uses the maximum peripheral frequency.

The user also needs to establish the AMux switch connections between the LEFT and RIGHT side of the analog muxes. As a recommendation, the user can use the device-configurator to connect the SAR ADC to the furthest pin, so the tool sets automatically the connections. The SAR ADC shall be configured to only use one channel. If the device is configured to use more than one channel, any readings from the additional channels has to be done outside of the scope of the Sampler.

When connecting a port using the `AMux_AddPort()` function, not all pins need to be connected to the AMux. In case a given pin is not connected, you might only use that pin as a GPIO controlled by the CPU. No connections to any peripheral are allowed, since the HSIOM register selection is set to ZERO when not connected, which translates to GPIO controlled by the CPU.

When using the Sampler middleware, the `Sampler_SetScanRate()` function requires to provide the SAR ADC sampling rate and the acquisition time. Both of these information are provided by the SAR ADC parameters in the device-configurator. The *Achieved Free-Run Scan Rate (sps)* shall be always higher than the value provided to the `Sampler_SetScanRate()` function. And the *Achieved aquisition time (ns)* shall be always smaller or equal than the value provided to the `Sampler_SetScanRate()`.

Currently, the code example supports up to 32 channels for muxing and sampling. If you want to change the number of muxing/sampling channels, add the definition of the `AMUX_MAX_NUM_CONNECTIONS` and `SAMPLER_MAX_NUM_CHANNELS` to the makefile. It can support up to 255 channels.
